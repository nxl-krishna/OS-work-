What is eBPF?

eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is like a "virtual machine inside the Linux kernel".
It lets you run small, safe programs in the kernel without writing kernel modules.

Think of it as a way to extend the kernelâ€™s power dynamically, while keeping it safe (programs are verified before running).

use of the ebpf 
networking 
Tracing syscalls, function calls, and kernel events.
Detect suspicious behavior (like rootkits, privilege escalations).
Custom schedulers, memory access tracking.

What is XDP?

XDP (eXpress Data Path) is a high-performance packet processing framework in the Linux kernel.

It lets you run small eBPF programs directly in the NIC(network interface card )driver, before the kernel network stack sees packets.
